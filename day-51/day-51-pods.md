- `kubectl apply -f` creates or updates a resource from a file
- `kubectl get pods -o wide` shows the node and IP address
- `kubectl describe pod <name>` shows events — very useful for debugging
- `kubectl logs <name>` shows container stdout/stderr
- `kubectl exec -it <name> -- /bin/sh` gives you a shell (use `/bin/sh` if `/bin/bash` is not available)
- Labels are just key-value pairs — they have no meaning to Kubernetes itself, only to selectors
- `--dry-run=client -o yaml` is your best friend for generating manifest templates
